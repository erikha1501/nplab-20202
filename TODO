+ A new dedicated class should manage game play (GameInstance ?)
    GameInstance will manage game logic and player connection in a seperated thread

+ Room should only store PlayerInfos (name, ip-endpoint, state) and room state (idle, playing)

+ Server handles all player interactions with a room (create, join, leave)

+ When all players are ready:
    1. Room owner attempts to start the game:
        Server sends GameInstance info (ip-endpoint) to all players and waits for acknowlegdement
        Players will communicate with GameInstance from then on

    2. GameInstance sends map info, player initial positions, ... and waits for acknowlegdement <waiting>
        GameInstance transitions to <started>

+ Should GameInstance be owned by other component?
    a) Owned: Room / Server ?
    b) Self-contained: GameInstance will refer to all players using their id.
